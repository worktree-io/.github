# Worktree

Open GitHub issues as isolated git worktree workspaces — directly in your editor.

A GitHub Action posts an **Open workspace** link on every new issue. One click clones the repo, checks out a dedicated branch, and opens it in VS Code, Neovim, JetBrains, Zed, or any editor you configure.
